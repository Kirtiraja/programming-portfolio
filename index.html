            <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
            <p>I'm originally from Santa Barbara, CA but left right after highschool to see the world. I traveled for several years to many places including Los Angeles, British Columbia,  and many parts of India. From ashrams in Mumbai to art conservation studios in Los Angeles,I gained immeasurable experience, skills, and friendships along the way that I will always be grateful for. After moving to Portland in 2006 I decided to put roots down and bought my first home in St John's at 27 years old and enrolled at PSU. I met an amazing woman who is now my wife of 4 years and graduated with a Bachelors in sociology.</p> <p>I've had many jobs from retail and hospitality to construction and healthcare. From running my own business to managing others businesses in Art conservation, Franchisee, Hospitality, Real Estate, Adventure Tours, and Healthcare admininstration.</p>
